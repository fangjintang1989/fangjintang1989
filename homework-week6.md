Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives

Testing
Important link in dev. process 
Activities spilt over to other phases
	OP development, test preparation, etc
	(partial) code exist before testing 
Dynamic/run-time/interaction problems
Medium/low defect situations 
Techniques and tools 
Coverage vs. reliability focus 
Cost: moderate

Defect prevention
Most effective if causes known Good at pervasive problems Low cost, due to downstream damage
Issue:up-front cost

Inspection
Good throughout dev. process 
Works on many software artifacts 
Conceptual/static faults High fault density situations
	non-blocking
	experience => efficiency improve 
Human intensive, varied cost

Formal verification
Positive confirmation/correctness 
On design/code with formal spec 
Low/no defect situations 
Practicality: high cost,benefit
Human intensive, rigorous training
(therefore, high up-front cost)

Fault tolerance
Dynamic problems (must be rare) High cost & reliability (low defect) 
Technique problems (independent NVP) 
Process/technology intensive

Failure containment
Similar to FT above, but even more so 
Rare conditions related to accidents 
Extremely high cost => apply only when safety matters 
Many specialized techniques 
Process/technology intensive
