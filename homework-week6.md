Pairwise comparisons between testing and other QA alternatives

testing vs defect prevention.
object: code vs implementation.
development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs implementation.
expertise level: low-high vs medium-high.
observation: failures vs errors & error sources.
problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs systematic errors or conceptual mistakes.
result interpretation: moderate vs intangible.
cost: medium(low-high) vs low.
 
testing vs inspection
object: code vs design,code and other software artifacts
development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs all
expertise level: low-high vs low-medium
observation: failures vs faults
problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs static & localized faults
result interpretation: moderate vs easy
cost: medium(low-high) vs low-medium

testing vs formal verification
object: code vs design/code with formal specification
development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs design/coding
expertise level: low-high vs high
observation: failures vs (absence of) faults
problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs local faults
result interpretation: moderate vs hard
cost: medium(low-high) vs high

testing vs fault tolerance
object: code vs operational software system
development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs in-field operation
expertise level: low-high vs high
observation: failures vs local failures
problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs operational failures in small areas
result interpretation: moderate vs hard
cost: medium(low-high) vs high

testing vs failure containment
object: code vs system with potential accidents
development activity/phase: testing phase and after vs in-field operation
expertise level: low-high vs high
observation: failures vs accidents
problem types: dynamic failures & related faults vs accidents and related hazards
result interpretation: moderate vs hard
cost: medium(low-high) vs highest
