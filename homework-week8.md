It can be expressed in two main methods as functional testing and non-functional testing to ensure the quality of a software system. I will take DOTA2, a computer game as an example.

Functional Testing

This is a type of black box testing that is based on the specifications of the software that is to be tested. The application is tested by providing input and then the results are examined that need to conform to the functionality it was intended for. Functional Testing of the software is conducted on a complete, integrated system to evaluate the system's compliance with its specified requirements.
As for DOTA2, it's like you play the game and try to tell if it fits your request that you wish, like the feel of control, tricksï¼ŒVisualization and so on.
There are five steps that are involved when testing an application for functionality.

Steps
Description

1.The determination of the functionality that the intended application is meant to perform.
2.The creation of test data based on the specifications of the application.
3.The output based on the test data and the specifications of the application.
4.The writing of Test Scenarios and the execution of test cases.
5.The comparison of actual and expected results based on the executed test cases.
An effective testing practice will see the above steps applied to the testing policies of every organization and hence it will make sure that the organization maintains the strictest of standards when it comes to software quality.
You can try to set a series of tests like movement, new psysical spells and magical spells effects, and control the hero to do such things to check if everything goes cool.

Unit Testing

This type of testing is performed by the developers before the setup is handed over to the testing team to formally execute the test cases. Unit testing is performed by the respective developers on the individual units of source code assigned areas. The developers use test data that is separate from the test data of the quality assurance team.
The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that individual parts are correct in terms of requirements and functionality.
We can test the role to do the psysical spells or magical spells alone and see if everyone of them goes well seperately.

Limitations Of Unit Testing

Testing cannot catch each and every bug in an application. It is impossible to evaluate every execution path in every software application. The same is the case with unit testing.
There is a limit to the number of scenarios and test data that the developer can use to verify the source code. So after he has exhausted all options there is no choice but to stop unit testing and merge the code segment with other units.

Integration Testing

The testing of combined parts of an application to determine if they function correctly together is Integration testing. There are two methods of doing Integration Testing Bottom-up Integration testing and Top Down Integration testing.

System Testing

This is the next level in the testing and tests the system as a whole. Once all the components are integrated, the application as a whole is tested rigorously to see that it meets Quality Standards. This type of testing is performed by a specialized testing team.
We can test when the psysical spells or magical spells goes well seperately, then put them together, use them freely to see if they still work weel.

Regression Testing

Whenever a change in a software application is made it is quite possible that other areas within the application have been affected by this change. To verify that a fixed bug hasn't resulted in another functionality or business rule violation is Regression testing. The intent of Regression testing is to ensure that a change, such as a bug fix did not result in another fault being uncovered in the application.

Acceptance Testing

This is arguably the most importance type of testing as it is conducted by the Quality Assurance Team who will gauge whether the application meets the intended specifications and satisfies the client.s requirements. The QA team will have a set of pre written scenarios and Test Cases that will be used to test the application.
More ideas will be shared about the application and more tests can be performed on it to gauge its accuracy and the reasons why the project was initiated. Acceptance tests are not only intended to point out simple spelling mistakes, cosmetic errors or Interface gaps, but also to point out any bugs in the application that will result in system crashers or major errors in the application.
By performing acceptance tests on an application the testing team will deduce how the application will perform in production. There are also legal and contractual requirements for acceptance of the system.
In this game, Icefrog is definitely the best tester as the man who had designed dota map. 

Beta Testing

This test is performed after Alpha testing has been successfully performed. In beta testing a sample of the intended audience tests the application. Beta testing is also known as pre-release testing. Beta test versions of software are ideally distributed to a wide audience on the Web, partly to give the program a "real-world" test and partly to provide a preview of the next release. In this phase the audience will be testing the following:
		Users will install, run the application and send their feedback to the project team.
		Typographical errors, confusing application flow, and even crashes.
		Getting the feedback, the project team can fix the problems before releasing the software to the actual users.
		The more issues you fix that solve real user problems, the higher the quality of your application will be.
		Having a higher-quality application when you release to the general public will increase customer satisfaction.
DOTA2 used to go beta testing before the computer game offically goes to public, and I played a liitle bit. It can help you to understand better if the whole software goes well.
		
Non-Functional Testing

This section is based upon the testing of the application from its non-functional attributes. Non-functional testing of Software involves testing the Software from the requirements which are non functional in nature related but important a well such as performance, security, user interface etc.
Some of the important and commonly used non-functional testing types are mentioned as follows:
Performance Testing
It is mostly used to identify any bottlenecks or performance issues rather than finding the bugs in software. There are different causes which contribute in lowering the performance of software:
		Network delay.
		Client side processing.
		Database transaction processing.
		Load balancing between servers.
		Data rendering.
		
Load Testing

A process of testing the behavior of the Software by applying maximum load in terms of Software accessing and manipulating large input data. It can be done at both normal and peak load conditions. This type of testing identifies the maximum capacity of Software and its behavior at peak time.
DOTA2 has an issue on this, that some gamer have trobules while they try to entry the game and the loading page never goes to next page. This is a pity that may caused by DOTA2's need of a flash memory.

Stress Testing

This testing type includes the testing of Software behavior under abnormal conditions. Taking away the resources, applying load beyond the actual load limit is Stress testing.
Security Testing
Security testing involves the testing of Software in order to identify any flaws ad gaps from security and vulnerability point of view. Following are the main aspects which Security testing should ensure:
		Confidentiality.
		Integrity.
		Authentication.
		Availability.
		Authorization. 
		Non-repudiation.
		Software is secure against known and unknown vulnerabilities.
		Software data is secure.
		Software is according to all security regulations.
		Input checking and validation.
		SQL insertion attacks.
		Injection flaws.
		Session management issues.
		Cross-site scripting attacks.
		Buffer overflows vulnerabilities.
		Directory traversal attacks.
In DOTA2, it is mainly about the login and the user's personal information while gaming with others.
